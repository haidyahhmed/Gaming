# Game Begin
- rolls the die,
- optionally moves one of his piece up or down one row (we call this a "sideways" move, because the piece is moved sideways relative to the direction of travel toward the finish line), and
- chooses one piece (either his or another player's) in the row indicated by the die roll and moves it one space to the right (i.e., "forward").
# Rules
- You cannot move your piece unless it is on the top of the stack.
- You cannot move your piece if it is placed on an obstacke.
- You can only pass the obstacle when there are no pieces before the piece on obstacle.
