# Game:- Hedgehogs in a Hurry (Igel Argern)
- This game is a sort of racing game for 2-6 players (best 4).
- Each player choses a color for his tokens.
- The standard game is played on a grid with 6 rows and 9 columns.
- Each player has four tokens (representing hedgehogs) that he or she must move from the left column to the right column.
- pieces sharing a square stack on top of each other. Only the piece on the top of a stack may move.
# Game Begin
1- rolls the die,
2- optionally moves one of his piece up or down one row (we call this a "sideways" move, because the piece is moved sideways relative to the direction of travel toward the finish line), and
3- chooses one piece (either his or another player's) in the row indicated by the die roll and moves it one space to the right (i.e., "forward").
# Rules
1- You cannot move your piece unless it is on the top of the stack.
2- You cannot move your piece if it is placed on an obstacke.
3- You can only pass the obstacle when there are no pieces before the piece on obstacle.
